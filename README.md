Project: Remote Administration tool

Remote Administration tool eliminates additional installation of software’s thus gives plug-and-play functionality to the users. It would be platform independent, so no matter what operating system is installed in the system, any operating system can use the system. Users have to configure minimal settings to let the other user connect. Also, it will be easy to use.

Required software’s that you must download to run the project

1)Download JDK for windows (32 bit or 64 bit) or Mac OS X, whatever is applicable
2)Download NetBeans

Installation

1)Install JDK and NetBeans

Usage

1.	Open NetBeans, goto File -> Open Project,
2.	Navigate to the "RAT" folder and select "server",
3.	Do the same for "client",
Client and Server are two different projects. Need to run the server first and then client.
4.	Run Server,
5.	You can enter "127.0.0.1" in the IP Address box and press "connect" to connect to the client.

Motivation

Our main motivation to create the project was TeamViewer. Our aim was to develop remote administration tool that has features of TeamViewer and also implement some features that are not available in TeamViewer. For example, http server and client connection ability, able to connect with client from browser etc.
